🚀 **Clueless Coders – Project v2: "Coding Social" Upgrade** 🔒

Hey team!

Hope you're ready to level up – because it’s time for **Version 2** of our Coding Social project! 🎯

### 🆕 What’s New in v2:

We're introducing **authentication**, **roles**, and **permissions**. This version is all about building real-world, scalable apps with proper access control.

### 🔐 Here's the plan:

* 🧑‍🎓 **Only registered users can access the app**
* 🧑‍💼 **Two roles**:

  * **Admin** 🛠️: Can create new users and manage all user profiles
  * **User** 🙋‍♂️: Can only manage their own profile (GitHub, LeetCode, Codeforces links)

### 🛠️ Features:

* ✅ Login/Register page (Only admins can create accounts for users)
* 🧾 Form for users to submit/edit their coding profile
* 📋 Admin dashboard to view/manage users and their submitted profiles
* 🚫 Role-based access control: prevent unauthorized access to pages or actions

### 🧱 Tech Stack Suggestions:

* Use **Next.js (App Router)** for frontend
* Backend-as-a-Service: **Appwrite**, **Firebase**, or **Supabase**
* Use **auth APIs** from your BaaS platform
* Style it clean & modern (Tailwind is your friend 😉)
